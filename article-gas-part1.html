        <p>October 9th was a very exciting day.</p>

        <p>No, I did not win the lottery, get a date, or ace an exam. It was exciting because on October 9th, 2024, I started tracking my gas purchases: gallons per fill-up, total cost, and price per gallon.</p>

        <p>Now, a full 365 days later, I have logged every single one. Comparing my numbers to AAA official data for North Carolina, I discovered that I paid a weighted average of $2.63 per gallon, 25% less than the average North Carolinian. And that is just based on pump prices, not even counting card-based cashback or third-party rewards.</p>

        <p>Today, I want to share some fun facts about my gas-guzzling Buick, show you how I saved hundreds of dollars at the pump, and how you can, too!</p>

        <h3>Painful Stats (my car is tired)</h3>

        <p>My car is called MC Prime, as in My Car Pain In My Rear End (it is an anagram) due to its constant low tire pressure indicator, frequent breakdowns, and overall rickety-ness. Although reviewing the numbers, I have much more compassion for good old MC.</p>

        <p>Over the past year, my 2006 Buick Lucerne has hauled me all over, back and forth to Raleigh, multiple trips to Charlotte, and more than 500 DoorDash deliveries. In between those longer trips, school, church, and daily errands added onto the annual totals, and I racked up over 14,000 miles.</p>

        <p>At an 18-mile-per-gallon average (I blame a 20-year-old car and Wilmington traffic), that works out to around 780 gallons and just over $2,000 roughly $170 per month spent on gas.</p>

        <p><em>Yeah, that hurts to write.</em></p>

        <p>I have even managed to keep driving past max capacity. Last August, I pumped 16.5 gallons into a tank rated for 16. In December 2024, I filled up eight times thanks to holiday driving and endless deliveries.</p>

        <p>When compared to AAA state average, I estimate I saved over $500 this year. I pumped roughly 3,000 pounds of gas, enough to drive the entirety of I-40 from Wilmington to Barstow, California and halfway back though I doubt my poor car would survive that long.</p>

        <h3>How I Beat the Pump by 25%</h3>

        <p>Let us break this down into three parts.</p>

        <h4>1. Front-End Savings (Pump Price)</h4>

        <p>This component has the most significant impact. By strategically timing my purchases, joining gas station rewards programs, and targeting newly opened stations with temporary discounts (thank you, Sheetz, for deciding to target ILM in 2025!), I consistently found prices lower than the average drivers.</p>

        <h3>Front-End MVPs: Sheetz, BP, and Circle K</h3>

        <p>Among the best programs for front-end discounts are Sheetz, BP, and Circle K. Sheetz and BP offer sign-up bonuses and ongoing 3 to 5 cent per gallon discounts. BP is also partnered with Harris Teeter and gives points from grocery purchases that can net you up to $1 off per gallon if you spend enough on your regular grocery run. Those programs add up nicely, but the real savings story starts with Circle K.</p>

        <p>When you sign up, you get 25 cents off per gallon on your first five fill-ups. Linking your bank account through Easy Pay gives an additional 50 cents off per gallon on the next five. You also get a 3 cent everyday discount and, after spending $500 in a year, a 5 cent discount for the remainder of the current year and the entirety of the next.</p>

        <p>Paying with Circle K Easy Pay debit card gives another 10 cents per gallon, but it is applied after the transaction, so it does not show on the pump; it only shows in your account, which has to be linked directly to the card bypassing credit card rewards but passing along those processing fee savings back to me.</p>

        <p>I spent over $600 at Circle K last year. Combining all those discounts, I estimate $75.98 in total savings, with about $24 already reflected at the pump and $51.44 credited afterward. Circle K is my fallback when no better promos are available, like rewards with third-party apps.</p>

        <p><em>Next time, we will go over the other two parts of the gas savings triangle: third-party rebates and card-based rewards.</em></p>
