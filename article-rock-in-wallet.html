        <p>In 1937, my great-grandfather Poppy built a tiny fishing shack on Lake Mattawa in Orange, Massachusetts. Over time, it grew from a shack to a one-story house, then to two stories with multiple bedrooms, and eventually into the modern home it is today. Through every addition, one thing never changed: the solid rock fireplace. It is simple, effective, and beautiful. Now, I wouldn't dare to compare my credit card system to Poppy's craftsmanship, but in my financial world, it plays a similar role. It's the piece that holds everything together.</p>

        <p>As I alluded to in my last article, <em>Credit Card Chaos</em>, my wallet is starting to look like a cluttered kitchen junk drawer, with credit, debit, and rewards cards packed inside. Today, however, I want to focus on the one card that anchors everything, the <strong>Fidelity 2% Signature Visa</strong>.</p>

        <p>It offers the basic features every solid card should have, including <strong>no annual fee</strong>, <strong>zero fraud liability</strong>, and <strong>no foreign transaction fees</strong>. It even provides a <strong>$100 TSA PreCheck credit</strong>, which I happily used during my spring trip to Omaha. One caveat: the card is issued and serviced by Elan Financial, not Fidelity directly. Their app and service aren't flashy, but they get the job done. The perks are nice, but they are not the reason this card is my cornerstone.</p>

        <p>The real power lies in the <strong>unlimited 2 percent cash back</strong> when deposited into an eligible Fidelity account. I have mine set to automatically redeem into my <strong>Fidelity Cash Management Account (CMA)</strong>, where it lands in <strong>SPAXX</strong>, Fidelity's money market fund, currently earning around four percent. Even with modest spending, I collect twenty to thirty dollars a month in cash back that quietly compounds. Over a year of averaging $25 monthly cashback, I've accumulated over $300, with an additional $30 in interest (and <em>dividends</em>!). Before August 2025, Fidelity required a minimum redemption, but they have recently removed it, making the system even smoother. Using Fidelity as a bank might sound strange. It is primarily a brokerage and investment firm, not a traditional bank. Although there are no branches, I don't need a free lollipop to manage my money.</p>

        <p>I have molded the CMA into what I call my <strong>Short-Term Strategic Reserve (STSR)</strong>, guided by my <strong>L.I.S.T. principle</strong>: <em>Liquidity</em>, <em>Income</em>, <em>Stability</em>, and <em>Tax efficiency</em>. The account includes a debit card that reimburses ATM fees worldwide, a free checkbook (if requested), and automatically sweeps idle cash into SPAXX. My Fidelity Visa automatically drafts from this account, creating a flywheel where spending earns rewards that flow right back into a high-yielding pool of cash and investments. It's cashback inception: spend, earn, reinvest, repeat.</p>

        <p>The CMA also doubles as a brokerage account. Dividends and capital gains flow directly into my cash balance. On July 27, my <strong>NEOS</strong> income funds paid forty-five dollars in dividends, and I immediately used cash from the account to buy breakfast. Although money is fungible, meaning a dollar in one bank account is equal to any other dollar in any other account I own, there's something incredibly satisfying about dividends covering bacon and eggs. I'm currently reading <em>Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens</em>, and she loves her cliffhangers, so I'll leave you with one. My STSR pays a blended annualized yield of over 10% while adhering to the L.I.S.T. principles. Next week, I'll take a break from the exhausting world of credit cards and explore what funds I use to beef up my savings.</p>

        <p><em>Poppy's fireplace has warmed our home for over 80 years. Like it, the Fidelity 2% Signature Visa steadily fuels my finances with the same dependable strength I'll need to fuel what's coming next. Hint: these aren't grandma's savings bonds.</em></p>
